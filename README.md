# Discord-Spoiler-Message-V2
A small program that generates a message using Discord's formatting to force a user to click on every letter if they wish to reveal the entire message; with the sole intent of annoying people (although its actually just to help me get started programming).
This is my new readme. I dont know what it does but it sounds important.
